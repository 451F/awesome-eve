Every now and then someone comes out with a list of third party tools. Rather than waiting on these posts let's put together something here. 

Process to be listed:

* Create an Issue, or even better yet a Pull Request with the name of your tool, the URL (or app name) of your tool, a category it should go into, and a very brief description of what it does.
* Your product should be user friendly and beyond "beta" stages.
* If approved, it will be added! Yay!

Since Eve apps and websites come and go we will try to check each of the them periodically and keep the list up to date.
